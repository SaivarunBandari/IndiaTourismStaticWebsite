                            places in your South India tour packages. Situated on the banks of the River Vaigai, Madurai is also referred to as Athens of the
                            East and Temple Town. Madhurai is the oldest continually inhabited city in the Indian peninsula, with a history dating all the way
                            back to the Sangam period of the pre-Christian era. It has been inhabited since at least the 3rd century BCE. It is considered as
                            the cultural capital of Tamilnadu. Madurai was the seat of power of the Pandyan Empire. It was built by the Pandyan king Kulasekhara
                            and was the capital city of the great Pandya kings of South India. It was later ruled by Cholas, Later Pandyas, Madurai Sultanate,
                            Vijayanagara, Madurai Nayaks and finally British. Pandyas and Nayaks contributed enormously to the development of Meenakshi Amman Temple
                            and Madurai city. Meenakshi Amman Temple (known as Madhurai Meenakshi) is the biggest landmark of Madurai.
                            It is one of the largest temples in India. The temple has a stunning architecture and a significant testimony for
                            Vishwakarma Brahmins for their master architecture in sculpting this temple. The core city of Madurai is built parallel to the
                            streets of Madhurai Temple. Along with Meenakshi Temple, Thirumalai Nayak Mahal & Koodal Alagar Temple are other important places
                            to visit in Madurai. Madurai is also a base station to visit Trichy, Thanjavur, Rameswaram and kodaikanal.
                            The Sangam period poet Nakkeerar is associated with some of the Tiruvilayaadal episodes of Sundareswarar -
                            that are enacted as a part of temple festival traditions even today.

                            At a distance of 56 km from Trichy, 112 km from Chidambaram, 86 km from Nagapattinam, 170 km from Madurai, 326 km from Chennai,
                            Thanjavur, also known as Tanjore, is a city and district headquarters in the state of Tamil Nadu. Thanjavur is famous for the Brihadeeswarar
                            Temple built by Rajaraja Chola in the year 1010 AD. Also known as the Big Temple, it is one of UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India and also
                            one of the popular places to experince Tamilnadu Tourism. Situated on the banks of River Cauvery, Thanjavur has a rich historical heritage and
                            is a must visit place in Thanjavur as part of Tamilnadu tour. The city was once the stronghold of the historic Cholas and at one time was also
                            the capital of the Cholas, Mutharayars and Marathas when they were at the peak of their power. Since then, Thanjavur has been one of the chief
                            political, cultural and religious centers of South India. Thanjavur became the most important city in the Chola Empire and remained its
                            capital till the emergence of Gangaikonda Cholapuram in about 1025. During the first decade of the eleventh century, the Chola king Raja
                            Raja Chola I (985-1014) constructed the Brihadeeswarar Temple. The temple is considered to be one of the best specimens of South Indian temple
                            architecture. Thanjavur is one of the older cities in Tamil Nadu and has a lot of significance in Dravidian history. Thanjavur was eventually
                            annexed along with the rest of the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I in 1279. Later it went into the hands of
                            Delhi Sultanate from whom Vijayanagara rulers have conquered. It was governed by Thanjavur Nayaks under Vijayanagara suzerainty. Thanjavur was
                            successfully conquered by Ekoji I in 1674, the Maratha feudatory of the Nawab of Bijapur and half-brother of Shivaji. Ekoji founded the Thanjavur
                            Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when
                            Shivaji II (1832-55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a male heir. Apart from Brihadeeswarar Temple, Thanjavur and the
                            surrounding areas have several important tourist attractions like Thanjavur Palace, Kumbakonam, Darasuram, Gangaikonda Cholapuram, Thiruvaiyaru,
                            Thirubuvanam, etc. It usually takes a full day to visit the places within Thanjavur town. Thanjavur is also famous for metal sculptures
                            moulded with great facial expressions and beautiful finish.
