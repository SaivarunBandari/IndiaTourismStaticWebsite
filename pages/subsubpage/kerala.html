                            This waterfall drops from a height of 80 feet through several parallel streams offering a great scenic beauty. In monsoon season,
                            the water gets strength and all the streams join together and appear like Niagara Falls. This is the biggest waterfalls in Kerala
                            and well known for its scenic beauty. Athirapally Waterfalls is one of the top attractions you must include in Munnar packages.
                            One can reach top of Athirapally falls with about 15 minutes walk from the falls entrance. It offers spectacular views of the
                            Sholayar hills and a unique view of the waterfalls from this spot. About 10-15 minutes trek down from top of the falls will
                            take you to bottom of the falls where the greatest beauty of the waterfalls can be experienced. Swimming is possible in the
                            stream at bottom of the Athirapally falls. Down from the waterfall, the stream continues as Chalakudy River which ultimately
                            drains into Arabian Sea. This river is a bio diversity hotspot with 85 species of fresh water fish living in it.
                            The Athirapally Forest is also the natural habitat of different species like the great hornbill, Malabar pied hornbill,
                            Malabar grey hornbill, Indian grey hornbill, Asiatic elephant, tiger, leopard, bison, sambar and lion-tailed macaque.
                            The Vazhachal Waterfalls, Charpa Falls, Anakkayam, Sholayar Dam, Valparai and Malayattur Wildlife Sanctuary are the nearby
                            places to visit in Athirapally. It also offers adventure activities like river rafting, trekking, etc.
                            Athirapally falls never dries out and can be visited anytime during the year. Though the waterfall appears in its full glory
                            during monsoons, heavy rains can cause great inconvenience. So, the best time to visit is from September to January.
                            It usually takes 2-3 hours to explore Athirappally falls.
