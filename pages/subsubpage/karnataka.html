                            Mysore Palace is a historical palace and a royal residence at Mysore in the Indian State of Karnataka.
                            It is the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore,
                            and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces',
                            and there are seven palaces including this one; however, 'Mysore Palace' refers specifically to this one within the Old Fort.
                            The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as puragiri (literally, citadel), and is now known as the Old Fort.
                            Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was demolished and constructed multiple times.
                            The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace was burnt ablaze.
                            Mysore Palace is now one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than 6 million annual visitors.
                            The architectural style of domes of the palace is commonly described as Indo-Saracenic, with blends of the Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles. 
                            It is a three-story stone structure with marble domes, and has a 145-foot five-story tower. The palace is surrounded by a large garden. 
                            The entrance gate and arch hold the emblem and coat of arms of the kingdom of Mysore, around which is written the kingdom's 
                            motto in Sanskrit: "न बिभॆति कदाचन" (never terrified).

                            Bangalore Palace is a palace located in Bangalore, Karnataka, India, in an area that was owned by Rev. J. Garrett,
                            the first principal of the Central High School in Bangalore, now famous as Central College. The commencement of the
                            construction of the palace is attributed to him. The property was purchased from Rev. Garrett in 1873 at a cost of 
                            Rs. 40,000 by the British Guardians of the minor Maharaja Chamarajendra Wadiyar 10 using his personal funds. 
                            They were in charge of his education and administrative training to ready him to take over his reign in 1881 AD. 
                            As the young Maharaja did not have a suitable place to stay during his training in Bengaluru, this property was purchased and transformed. 
                            Construction of a palace building was started in April 1874 and completed by 1878. Mr. Cameron of Lalbagh did the landscaping. 
                            Many additions and improvements were carried out in subsequent years. In the later years, Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar 
                            added some portions outside of Durbar Hall e.g. the twin external staircase and platform for musicians. 
                            The palace has a floor area of 45,000 sft, and grounds of 454 acres (183 ha). 
                            The sprawling grounds surrounding the Palace is used for holding public events including music concerts
                            The palace was built in Tudor Revival style architecture with fortified towers, battlements and turrets. 
                            The interiors were decorated with elegant wood carvings, floral motifs, cornices and relief paintings on the ceiling. 
                            The furniture, which was neo-classical, Victorian and Edwardian in style, was bought from John Roberts and Lazarus. 
                            The upkeep of the gardens was the responsibility of the horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel. 
                            A total of 35 rooms were built in the palace with most of them being bedrooms and a swimming pool. 
                            The renovation included addition of stained glass and mirrors, specially imported from England, 
                            besides a manual lift and wooden fans from General Electric
