                        <h4>GEOGRAPHY AND HISTORY:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Central India is a loosely defined region of India consisting of the states of Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh.
                            Indore, the commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh is the largest city in the region. Other major cities include Bhopal and Raipur.
                            The states share many linguistic and cultural characteristics with the Northern Region including the predominance of Hindi.
                            The states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have been grouped along with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand as the Northern Zonal Council
                            for cooperation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Bhimbetka caves show evidence of paleolithic settlements in present-day Madhya Pradesh.
                            Stone age tools have also been discovered at various places along the Narmada river valley.
                            Chalcolithic sites have been discovered at a number of places including Eran, Kayatha, Maheshwar, Nagda, and Navdatoli.
                            Rock shelters with cave paintings, the earliest of which can be dated to 30,000 BCE, have also been discovered at a number of places.
                            The settlements of humans in present-day Madhya Pradesh developed primarily in the valleys of rivers such as Narmada, Chambal, and Betwa.
                            During the early Vedic period, the Vindhya mountains formed the southern boundary of the Indo-Aryan territory.
                            The Holkars, a powerful family of the Maratha Empire were based out of Indore. Later,
                            the territory that now comprises Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh were ruled by numerous princes who entered into subsidiary alliance with the British.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After independence, the states of Madhya Bharat, Vindhya Pradesh, and Bhopal were merged into Madhya Pradesh in 1956.
                            In 2000, the new state of Chhattisgarh was carved out of Madhya Pradesh.
                        </p>
                        <h4>CULTURE:</h4>
                        <p>
                            Central Indian cultural history spans more than 4,500 years. During the Vedic period (c. 1700 – c. 500 BCE), the foundations of Hindu philosophy,
                            mythology, theology and literature were laid, and many beliefs and practices which still exist today, such as dhárma, kárma, yóga, and mokṣa,
                            were established. India is notable for its religious diversity, with Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Islam, Christianity, and Jainism among the
                            nation's major religions. The predominant religion, Hinduism, has been shaped by various historical schools of thought, including those of the Upanishads,
                            the Yoga Sutras, the Bhakti movement, and by Buddhist philosophy.
